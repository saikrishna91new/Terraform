Provisoning with out terraform: 
1> Slow Deployment 
2> Expensive
3> Limite Automation
4> Huma Error
5> Wasted resource
6> Inconsistancy 


Iac tool resolve thi, this can be archived with scripting languages also but reusability is difficult

Types of automation tools 1> Configuration management 2> Server template 3> provisioning toolss

1> Configuration management : Ansible, puppet, chef : Install and manage softare, maitain standers structure, version control and idemptent

2> Server template: Docker, packer, vagrant : preinstall software and dependanciesm vm or docker images, Immutable infrastructure

3> Provisoning tools: Terraform : Deploy immutable infrastucture , support multiple providers through plugins



Terrafrom: 
supports multiple providers major, uses HCL 
configuration files ends with .tf and maintain version control system

Declerative: will bring the current state to desired state with out our interbention


Terraform lifecycle:

3 phases

1>Init: intialise the project andd identofy the providers needed for target environment
2>Plan: draft a plan to get the target state
3>Apply: Make the changes on target env to bring the desired state

** For some reason any configuration drift happens then the subsequent terrafom apply will revert that

RESOURCE: every object manges by the terrraform, TF will manages the resource life cycle like create, update and destroy

STATE FILE: Record the state of infra as it is in real world, based on this TF will take actions wily apply command, by this TF ensured desired state always

INSTALLATION: Single binary and execution files

Version: TF keep on updating version , Latest: V0.13.0

TF uses HCL with .tf extenion. it contains blocks & parameters as key value pairs

eg: 

resourcce "aws_instance" "webserver" {
		ami = "ami-id"
		.....
		}

resource is the block name and aws_instance is the resource type here aws is provider and instance is resource and followed by logical name to save that 
resource in the state file,, ARguments are places insde the {} brackets in this mandatory and optional args are available


Terrafaform plan: will gives the blue print with all the arguments displayed in the configuration file and as well as some optional args

Terraform Show: displays the resource created by the terrafrom and show the things in state file 

+ create new,, - : destroy,, -/+ destroy and create

terrafrom destroy : will destroy the things recorded in state file and to destroy the specific resource "terraform destroy <resourcce-id>"


Configuration directory: contain terraform configuration files with .tf extenion and no limit for the .tf file code can go unlimited and TF will support 
multiple providers in same working directory and TF recoginse them by seeing the TF configuration files



Input variables:
----------------

Instead of hardcoding the variables we can use dynamic variables for reussabilty which is main perpose of terraform 
 variable block is used to decalre the variables

EG: 
	variable "variable_name" {
			type= string
			description = "give some descritpion if you want"
			defaultr = "default value if not ddefined the variable any where"
			}


Above we have declareed the variable then how to call the variable in the configuration files var.<variable_name>


EG:

		variables.tf
				
				variable "ami" {
					type = string
					desccription = "ami used in the configuration"
					}

		main.tf
			
				resource "aws_instance" "webserver"	{
					type = "t2.micro"
					ami = var.ami
					}


Variable args: as showed aboed above we have some fixed and optional args in variable block like default, type, desccription... etc

Various variable types:
-----------------------

Basic type: string, number, bool, any (default)
Additional: list, map, object, tuple

type string
___________
variable "string_var" {
	type = string
	default = "sai krishna"
	}

type number
___________

variable "number_var" {
	type = number
	default = 5
	}

type bool > which have only two values either true or falls
__________

variable "boolean_var" {
	type = bool
	default = true
	}




LIST: 
----
 Number collection of elements bcz each values is indexed and begins with zero


variable "list_variable" {
		type = list
		default = ["sai", "krishna", "nitturu"]
		}

here
var.list_variable[0] = sai
var.list_variable[1] = krishna
var.list_variable[2] = nitturu



MAP:
___

Map is defined in key value pair and no limit for number of variables

variable "map_variable" {
		type = map
		default = {
			firstname = "Sai"
			secondname = "krinshna"
			lastname = "Nitturu"
			}
		}

var.map_variable["firstname"] = sai
var.map_variable["secondname"] = krishna
var.map_variable["firstname"] = Nitturu

List with type we can define what type of vaariables can go inside

List with type string

variabble "list_string" {
	type = list(string)
	default = ["sai","krishna"]
	}

List with type num

variable "list_number"	{
	type = list(number)
	default = [1,3,4]
	}

If we pecify the list as tring and we mention the values as number terraform thows error as variable is not compatiable

Same types applied to map as well

variable "map_string" {
	type = map(string)
	default = {
		one = "onee",
		two = "two"
	}
	}

variable "map_number" {
	type = map(number)
	default = {
		one = 1,
		two = 2
		}
	}

SET:
---
set is similar to list but only differance is it doesn't accept the duplicate values, accessing use indexing start with 0 as list
EG:
	variable "set" {
		type = set
		default = ["one" , "two", "three"]
		}
	var.set[0] = one
	var.set[1] = two
		
If we place any duplicates terraform will throws an error


OBJECT:
------
Complex data structure with a combination of all variable types like list, string, num, bool , map ..etc

variable "object" {
	type = object( {
		name = string
		age = number
		date = list(num)
		job = bool
		})
	default = {
		name = "sai"
		age = 30
		date = [7,7,2022]
		job = true
		}
	}


Tuple:
_____

Similr to list but accept the different types of vaariables like string, numberm bool 

variable "tuple" {
	type = tuple([string, number, bool ])
	default = [ "cat", 7 ,true ]
	}
		
variable type order declared in the type argument need to match with the variables in values if not error will occur


Types of inputting the variables:
--------------------------------

1> Interactive mode: we just declared varibles and not defined any where then it will ask for the input at run time while terraform apply command
   ----------------

2> Command line: while terraform apply command we can pass the variable with the -var option
   ------------
		variable.tf
		-----------
		variable "name" {
			typr = string
			}

		terraform apply -var "variable_name=variable_value"
		terraform apply -var "name=sai"
3> Environment variable: define the environment variables with the export option at OS level with the syntax "TF_VAR_<variable_number>="value"
   --------------------
			variable.tf
		-----------
		variable "name" {
			typr = string
			}
		
			EG:     export $TF_VAR_name = "sai"


4> Variable defination files:  Files ending with terrafrom.tfvars or <any_name>.auto.tfvars (test.auto.tfvars) 
   --------------------------
		eg: terraform.tfvars
				
				name = "sai"
				age = 8

5> External file location: can pass .tfvars file from any other location by using -var-file option
   ----------------------
				terraform apply -var-file /usr/sai/terraform.tfvars

Variable precedency
-------------------

At what options terraform will check the for the variable values from the above list 

1> command line : terraform apply -var "name=sai"
2> *.auto.tfvars
3> terraform.tfvars.json
4> terraform.tfvars
5> Environment variable 
6> varibles.tf       : here we can define variable with the argument default equals to



RESOURCE ATTRIBUTES:
-------------------
In real how to link 2 resources, every resource has set of attributes will give output like id which is standerd to recognise in cloud,, this can be used 
for other resource EG: vpc id needed for subnet to attach here subnet is depends on VPC,

which resource gives with output attribute: refer in Terraform registry provider section 

Syntax: ${resource_type.resource_name.attribute}

These is called dependancy 2 types of dependancies 1> Implicit 2> Explicit

1> Implicit dependancy: 

It will refer the some other resource output attribute id with in the same configuration files 
source resource : which has to create first and that output uses by other resource called destination resource ,, so source need to create first and after
destination next terraform automatically recogise this while destroy also TF reverse the order deletes the destination first and then source

syntax:      ${resource_type.resource_name.attribute}

2> Explicit dependancy:

specify the dependancy in the configurtion file with the depends_on argument and add in that which resource has to be complete first

EG:		resourcce "aws_intnace" "webserver" {
				ami = "ami_id"	
				....
				depends_on = [ 
					aws_sg.sec_group
						]
					}
		resource "aws_sg" "sec_group" {
				name = "sg"
				....
				}

Above example aws_inst is dependent on aws_sg so aws_sg need to create first then aws_instance
USE CASE: when resource dependancy is there independantly and unable to call implicit dependancies 


OUTPUT Variable:
----------------
To store an expression into a variable in Terraform, like every resource will give some output attributes we can see that in the terraform doccumentry 
we can store this in some varibles with output blocks and can use them in other resources 

Synatx: resource_type.resource_name.attribute_id :: here atttribute is the predefined for each resource

EG:
		resource "aws_s3" "my_bucket" {
				name = "bucket"
				region = "region"
				}
		output "bucket_id" {
				value = aws_s3.my_bucket.id
				}

terraform ourput  > to display the output variables stored this is effect only after terraform apply 
terraform output variable_name > to display the specific variable output eg from above code : terraform output bucket_id


USE CASE: 
1> Quickly display the details of the provisoned resource
2> To input the other scripts and ansible
3> To use for implicit dependancy 


TERRAFROM STATE:

which record all the things configred by the terraform, for terraform plan it refresh the in memorey or remote state file first and validate the
configuration if it finds any things to create or destroy it will print the plan,,, terraform apply also do the same refresh before apply and also print 
the same plan again

State file has assigne unique resourse id for every object, it is a json data structure maps real world defination to resource def in configuration files
it will create only after one successfull terraform apply 

when ever any changes happen then terraform update the state file with new details and resource id

What values are stored in the terraform: 	

Terrafrom store all the resourcce details like attribute given in configration and as well optional attribute and assign a resource id also stores the 
metadata usefule for destory and apply order while dependancy occurs


PERFORMANCE: 
-----------

If staet file got refreshed every time for all terraform plan and apply but in real time it will take more time bcz of no of resource so we can skip this
refresh state if we are sure no changes are happen out side terrafrom, use "terraform plan --refresh=false" same for apply as well so it wont refersh the 
state file and take the existing stae file as single source of truth


REMOTE STATE FILE:
------------------

While working as team multiple team members work on the terraform scripts and here terraform state file will store in the working directory that may 
cause the data loss or corruption of state file so go for remote state file which will be same for all the worker despite of the place where they are 
executing the code

terraform state file store sensitive infermation like password and user id details in plain text so always store it in secure place and restrict the access
as much as possible


BEST PRACTISE:
______________
1> store the configuration files in any version control system to make that available for all the team members
2> store the state file in any cloud storage like aws s3, terraform cloud..etc with security 



TERRAFORM COMMANDS:
___________________

1> terrafrom validate: syntax check of configuration files if any error occurs displays the line number and hint to resolve that

2> terraform format : format the terraform files in the configuration directory in canonical form and display the output as file names changed

3> terrafrom show: displays the resources stored in the terrafom state file, to disple one resoure "terrafrom show resource_id"

4> terrafrom list: list the resource ids in the stae file s

5> terraform provider : to list the providers available in the present working directory

6> terafrom providers mirror: to copy the modules from one directory to other directoy

7> terrafrom refresh : refresh the state with the current infra this is auto done by plan and apply commands as well

8> terrafrom graph: this is represnets the graphical representation of the dependancy in the configuration files & execution plan store in .graph can pass 
				it to graphviz for more visualization


Mutable VS Immutable:
____________________

Mutable: changable environment like applying the os patches 
Immutable: non-changable eg for os update destory the old resource and create the new one here resource is assume as EC2


Terraform is always immutable for every change it will destroy and recreate the new resourc, we can change this by lifecycle policy

 
LIFECCLE RULES:
--------------

3 rules are there in lifecycle

1> create_before_destory = true
2> prevent_detroy = tru
3> ignore_changes



1> Create_before_destroy : By default applying any changes terraform will destroy the existing resource first and then create the new we can change this by 
using this policy so terraform create the new resource first and detroy the existing one 

eg: 
		resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
				ami = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
				name = "nnnnn"
				lifecycle {
				create_before_destroy = true
					}
			}


2> prevent_destroy = true : this feature won't destroy the resource at all if we try error come as disble the policy

eg:
		resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
			ami = "xxxxxxxxxx"
			name = "nameee"
			lifecycle {
				prevent_detroy = true
				}
			}

3> Ignore_changes: If any thing changes out side the terraorm after terraform apply then for subsequest apply command will revert that to avoide this 
feature use this rule

eg :	
			resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
				ami = "aaaa"
				name = "nnn"
				lifecycle {
					ignore_changes = [
						tags,resourcese
					]
				}

			above code excludes the specific attribute changes like tags and ami if we want to ignore all the changes write the code as
				
				lifecycle {
				ignore_changes =all
					}




DATA SOURCE: 
____________

In terrrafrom we can read any resource attributes created outside the terrafrom by using the data source block, Terrafrom has provided these data source 
for specific resources and also provides whihc attributes we can read

synctax : data "resource_type" "resource_name" {	
				attribute = "attribute to find"
				}
we can use this with the expression : data.resource_type.reource_name.attribute


eg: update the new code here


META ARGUMETS:
--------------

Will comes inside resource block and changes the functionality of the resurce we already covered the lifecycle and depends_on earlier other are count and 
for_each

Count:
------
For creating the multiple resources with the same confiration with in a same resource block give the variable count greate than one, like a loop it will
execute the resource block as many times it is given by count and refer it as count.index

eg: 			variable "name" {
				type = list(string)
				default = [ "first" , "second" , "third" ]
				}
			resource "aws_intance" "webserver" {
				ami = "ami-id"
				name = var.name[count.index]
				count = 3
				#if we are not sure with the lenght of variable use "count = lenght(variable.name) will give the lenght as a value to count
				}

above code will execute 3 times and create 3 instances and the logical name or resource id's are stored as index values start with zero in state file
like webserver[0],webserver[1],webserver[2] 

Negitive for this is if we want to destory any one resource among these 3 terraform will destory all 3 and recreate reming two why becaus the index id miss
match if we remove any one then indes id are only 2 like 0 and 1 so previous index 1 to index 0 now which not satisfy terrafrom and recreate entire 
resource again as per it policy


this can be overcome by for_each attribute

for_each: 
--------
>only work for either set or map type of variables only , it store the resource ids with the variable value so no miss match happend and dont delete the
neede ones while recreating 

eg:			variable "name" {
				type = set(string)
				default = [ "first" , "second" , "third" ]
				}
			resource "aws_intance" "webserver" {
				ami = "ami-id"
				for_each = var.filename
				# here variable type is not either set or map then call as  "for_each=toset(var.name)" 
				name = each.value
				}


Version constraints:
-------------------

Terraform init always prefer to download the latest version if we have any dependancies with the speicific version mention that in configuration file with 
in the terraform block 

eg:
		terrfrom {
			required_version {
				local = {
					source = "hashicorp/aws"
					version = "1.4.0"
					}
				}
			}

above ode will download the version 1.4.0 exactly and there are sever ways in defining the version 
		>> version = "!=2.0.0"  not download the specific version
		>> version = "<1.4.0"  download any available version less than 1.4.0
		>> version = ">1.4.0"  download any available version greater than 1.4.0
		>> version = ">1.2.0,<1.8.0, !=1.2.0"  download any available version greate than 1.2.0 and less than 1.8.0 and not equals to 1.2.0
		>> version = "~>1.2"  either same 1.2 version or incremental upto 1.9
		>> version = ~>1.2.0" either same 1.2.0 version or incemental upto 1.2.9 here only last decimal is increments and go to max 9



Remote state and state lock:
___________________________


State file lock ensures that no concurrent apply or plan happens at same time so its lock the statefile while executing the terraform called "state locking"

In real time if we put the code in bit bucket or any other version controlling systems state locking can't archive as the users pull the code to their local
and execute it so new state file is created and same time other team member can pull the source code and apply so those two state files mismatch while they
reupload to bitbucket meanwhile if another team haven't pull the updated data it leads to corrupt or data loss ,, how to overcome?? Remote state

Remote state:
-------------
Store the state file in remotley like anu cloud and open db table for locking so who ever is working will point to same state file and have same locking 
through dynamo db table also encrypt the state file is the best practice in real time for security compliance

we can define this in terrafrom block with remote backend
prerequisites: as per aws
1> s3 bucket to store state file
2> dynamo db table for state locking

eg:				terraform {
					backend "s3" {
						bucket = "_______"
						key = "___________"
						region = "____________"
						dynamodb_table = "_____________"
						}

**note: best practise store this remote configuration code part superratly in provider.tf instead of main.tf

While  configuring the remote state first time it will require terrafrom init to copy the local state file to remote once it complete we may delete the 
local stae file 



STATE COMMANDS:
______________
Its difficult to edit the stae file manually but we can have some command which manipulate the state file 

1> terrafrom state list > print all resource ids in state file
2> terraform state list <respurce-id> : list the specific respource id 
3> terrafrom move <resource_id> <source> <destination>: can move the resource from one location to other or with in the same file called renaming a resource
4> terrafrom state pull : to pull a remote sate file to local 
5> terrafrom steate rm <resource_address> :: remove the specific resource from state file not from configuration and real infra




Provisoners:
____________

Running commands remotley  or locally
2 types 1> remote_exec (run on target resource) 2>local_exec (run on local where terraform installed)

provisoner block come inside resource blocak

eg: 					resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
						ami= "_"
						instance_type = "t2.micro"
						provisoner "remote_exec" {
							inline = ["yum update",
								    "yum install httpd"	
								   ]
							}
						connection	{
							type = "ssh"
							host = self.public
							user = "ubuntu"
							private_key = file("/tmp/privatekey.pem")
							}
						}

In the above example we mentioned connection block as well with remote_exec whihc is mandatory to check the connectivity for remote_exec that is pur
responsibility for best practise user boot sstrap script instead of remote_exec


local_exec for execute commands locally this is work in some cases where we have to dump the resourcing provising we are into one file in local

eg:					resource "aws_instance" "weberver"	{
						ami = "........."
						...
						provisoner "local_exec" {
						commad = "echo ${aws_instance.webserver.ip} > /tmp/iplist
						}
						}				


Provisoner by default create after resorce creation is called "Create time provisoner"
Destroy time provisoner will run before destroying a resource by placing a string "when = destroy" inside provisoner block if there is any failure inside
the provisoner block terrafrom mark that as taint and will recreate on the subsequent apply we can overcome this by "on_failure = continue"

on_failure has 2 options "fail" and "continue" by default on_failure is fail and taint the resource for next apply

provisoner behaviour
1> Creation time provisoner"  2> Destroy time provisoner 3> on_failure is fail or continue




Terrafrom Taint and untaint:
---------------------------

If any resource failed to create the terrrafrom mark it as taint and create for the next apply that will show in the terraform plan command as 
terrafrom tainted the perticuler resource and do create for next time

we can manually taint and untaint thee resource with commands

terrafrom taint aws_instance.webbserver   (syntax: terrafrom taint resourcetype.resoircename)

use cases: 1> when we want to make any resource recareate while any changes happen outside of terrafrom in that case taint the resource that will 
recreate fir next apply


UNTAINT:
-------
terrafrom untaint aws_instance.webbserver   (syntax: terrafrom untaint resourcetype.resoircename)





Logging:
-------
By default terrafrom wont display any logs so if we want to check the logs for debugging we have to export the variables at os level

to write the logs export a variable TF_LOG with any option from the following (info,warning,error,debug,trace)
EG: export TF_LOG = trace  >> trace has the highest priority 

By this terrafrom display log out put while executing the terrafrom commands on the screen but it wont store them at nay location , to stoer the log at any
location we have to export one more variabble TF_LOG_PATH with the file path
EG: export TF_LOG_PATH = /tmp/debug.log

to clear the variables exported prior is  :: unset <variable name>    eg: unset TF_LOG



Terrafrom import: 
----------------

There may be chances that any resource can create outside the terrafrom with other configuration tools or manually in that case we can import that resource 
to terrafrom to bring that into terrafrom control to perform the operations , steps to do import a resource

step1: add a empty resource block in the configuration file    
		resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {}
		#here webserver is the logical name for state file can be user control we can give any name and use same name in import command

step2: import coomand
		terrafrom import aws_instance.webserver <instnace_id>
		# here we have to give the instnace_idd of that specific resource whihc will unique for that we can get it from console

step3: After the import take the configuration attributes from the state file with terrafrom state show command add them appropriatly inside the empty block
	 added in step1 , and check with terrfrom plan expected outptu is not to create any thing if configuration is properly added



Modules:
--------
 In real time we have to create  multiple resources that may be some similar resource multiple time that cause duplication in code and repeteting copy work 
causes errors in code 
terrafrom can't put you any limit in the number of lines and blocks in terrafrom configuration files , we can split them into peaces that also cause 
duplicate work so we can use modules 

By modules we can place entire code in any directory and use them from where ever we want 

Module is the direcctory where we place the configuration files 
required blocke is module block in main.tf and required argument is source whihch is path to code and we can pass any variables to code from here

2 types of modules : 1> Root modules (where we are running thee code)  2> chaild module (where the code placed)

EG :1> place the code in /root/aws_instnace  (main.tf, variables.tf) ---- chaild module
	2> use the module from /tmp/aws_instacne likee blow
		main.tf
		-------
			module "module_name" {
				source = "/root/aws_instance"
				}


After writing the module we needed terrafrom init which will down load the provides as well as the chaild module configuration to present working directory

resource name is referred as >>> module.module_name.reesource_type.resource_name >> in state file usually it is "reesource_type.resource_name"

Advantages:

1> Simple configuration avoide duplicates
2> Test and validated code will be used as modules so no errors occur
3> Reusability we can use the same module for n number of times


Registry modules:
-----------------

instead of writing code and using it in loca terrafrom registry it self we can get modules from the providers directly like aws, gcp ,, etc,, we can get the details of that module like published by 
whome, when and versions, dependant modules, source code path and sample code referance to use the module, reuired and optional input and output variables 
for that module

EG: main.tf 

		module "registory_module_any_name" {
			source = "path mentioned in the terrafrom"		
			.......required arguments......
			}



Terrafrom functions:
-------------------

1> file  : to read a file       display_data = file("/tmp/output.txt")

2> lenght : gives lenth of a variable     


 variable "rules" {
		type = list
		default = [ "sai", "krishna" , "name" ]
		}	
 lengt=length(var.rules)				# gives output as 3 


						
3> toset: convert the variable type from one type to another 

	
variable "rules" {
		type = list
		default = [ "sai", "krishna" , "name" ]
		}	
 lengt=toset(var.rules)


4> Terrafrom console: where we can run and test the functins with the variables available values in state file and configuration files before using the 
functions in main code 
	terrafro console 

types of functions: 
------------------

1> numeric 2> string 3> collection 4> type


1> Numeric: work on expression like min,max,ceil,floor
	max(-1,4,7,11) = results 11
	min(-1,4,7,11) = results -1
	ceil(10.1) = results the whole number rqulas to greater than taht = resutls 11
	floor(10.1) = results the whole number rqulas to lesser than taht = resutls 10

2> String: split, upper, lower, substr, tittle, join

	eg:
		variable "string_var" {
				type = string
				default = "ami-abc,ami-cde,ami-fgh"
				}
	split: will split the string with a specific parameter and move them to a list
	we can call it 2 ways directly provide the string in variable like >> split (",","ami-abc,ami-cde,ami-fgh")  >> ["ami-abc", "ami-def","ami-ghi"]
												 >> split (",",var.string_var)  >> ["ami-abc", "ami-def","ami-ghi"]


	lower - convert all letters into lower case    lower(var.string_var)
	upper - convert all letters into upper case
	title - convert only first letter into upper tittle("sai") - Sai
      substr: to extract the small peice of a string 
		variable "string_var" {
				type = string
				default = "saikrishn"
				}
		substr(var.string_var,0,2)    - sai 				# starting letter index is 0
	      substr(var.string_var,3,8)	- krishna
	join: join a set of string with a speicifc charecter opposite to split
		
				variable "string_var" {
				type = list(string)
				default = ["sai","krishna","nitturu"]
				}
	
		join(",",var.string_var) = sai,krishna,nitturu
		join(".",var.string_var) = sai.krishna.nitturu

3> Collection functions: index, elements, contains
		
	index: retursn the index number of a list 
	element: return the values of a list with give index number 
	contains: check wether the element is there ir not in the list and returns true or falls

			variable "string_var" {
				type = list(string)
				default = ["sai","krishna","nitturu"]
				}

			index (var.string_var, "sai") - 0
			index (var.string_var, "krishna") - 1
			element (var.string_var, 0) - sai
			element (var.string_var, 2) - nitturu
			contains (var.string_var, "sai") - true
			contains (var.string_var, "test") - false

4> Map Specific: keys , values, lookup
			keys - will return the keys of the strings into list
			values - will return the values into list
			lookup - will check the specific value with specific key if not find return default value
		
			variable "map_var" {
				type = map
				default = {
					"first_name" = "sai"
					"second_name" = "krishna"
					"surname" = "nitturu"	
					}
					}
				keys (var.map_var) = ["first_name" , "second_name" , "surname" ]
				values (var.map_var) = ["sai", "krishna" , "nitturu"]
				lookup - syntax (variable_name, key, default_value)
				lookup (var.map_var,surname) = nitturu
				lookup (var.map_var,test,noname) = noname

5> conditional operations
		1> arthematic : +,-,*,% ..etc    : 1+1 = 2 
		2> comparison operator (gives true or falls) : <,>,<=,>=,!=,== 
		3> logical and && , logical or ||   - check the truth table in google
		4> If case:			condition? <value if true> : <value if false>			
			
			length = var.length < 8 ? 8 : var.length
				if true it will take 8
				if valse it will take var.lenght as input



Workspace: creating different projects in same work directory and use for different projects
even though it is remote state file there will be one to one relation with state and config directory so code can't duplicate for similar resourcce for diff
projects resove this work space maintain superate state files for each work space that is the idea

default work space is default cant be deleted

create a work space >>>>>>>>> terraform workspace project-b <<<< this is the command and after creating it will point to the latest one
list the work space : terrafrom workspace list  : * will be there at the present work space
select the work space: terrafrom workspace selet <name> to go for the workspace


if work spaces are there then state files listed at terrafrom.tfstate.d directory and inside that dir name with workspace name and then store state files









Additional points:
------------------

terrafrom apply  -- command will ask user input every time for this action to avoide this provide -auto-approve to apply automatically
>>>>>>>>>>>>>  terrafrom apply -auto-approve


to check the default and optional arguments required for the specific resource check in the terrafrom doccumentry 


While terrafrom going to recreate anything it will displey that in the plan aas -/+ symbol and also what causes this to recreate "~" symbol

terrafrom destroy also need user input use auto-approve too override it


resource attibutes defautl geneated while creating can refer in other places



variable default value can be overwrite any time
-var has the highest priority


empty variable block alos valid one as there is no default we are giving

senstive arg in variable block accept true or false either if its true then terrfarom plan and apply commands will supress that data in blue print but state
file wills store it as it is with out seeing this sensitive arg

Validation: in variable block validates the input value for the variable we can ise terrfarom inbuilt values like substr, split ..etc if its not valid 
terrafrom throws an error 

Type conversion: if specify the variable type as string and we have defined as number then terrafrom will automatically convert that into string this called
type conversion only available for string to number and string to boolean only,, if type conversion is not available for specific type it throws an error


in map variable we can mention as many as default variables

Output variable: uised to store an expression value in terrafrom, can have description as well and will display for every teeraform apply


Dependancy: 
Once resource got created terrafrom will generate some default attributes which can use as the input to other resource as implicit dependacny , these are 
mentioned in the terrafrom doccumentroy , TF will follow the order in this scenarios


Resource targetting: to appy the changes on specific resource instead of entiore configuration is done by target same for destroy as well
terrafrom apply/destroy -target resource_type.resource_name



Data block need to provide some key name arguments as mentioned in terrafrom doccumentss to identoy uniqely can use multiple keys and in filer key we can 
filter by using the tags here



state:

TF default create bkp for the state file its a json structure

detailed info about all attributes including required and optional

-refresh=false stop TF to refersh the state while plan and apply but writes after apply

usefull for large env which takes time 

stores metadata as well like dependancies to folow order of allow or deny

Remote state:

-----------

for first time with remote state ask for copy provide input as yes
next time while apply state taken from remote and put the dynamodb to lockk state and release after apply

terrafrom stae pull - to pull from remote to local

any changes to state file update it to configuration files to avoid recreating for next apply


terrafrom push command to push the loca stae file to over write the remote state file if completly differance between local and remote state file then tf 
throws an error like so much differance and ask force command to overwrite forcefully 


taint: if any resourcce got failed to create while apply command then terrfarom make as taintined and recrete that foe next apply we can see this in 
terrafrom plan that the resource got tainted and about to recreate

terrafrom apply -replace="resource-name" is preffered thant terrafrom taint

use full when we force a resource to create when manual changes happend to avoide the destory to avoide much steps so do a taint like this
terrafrom taint resource_type.resource_name

can do untaint with terrafrom untaint resource_type.resource_name 


LOG levels: info, warning, error , debug, trace

variables TF_LOG, TF_LOG_PATH, unset to remove 

import: resource id is required and not update the config file only state file it updates add emty block with proer resource_type before import

terraform import  resource_type.resource_name attribute

locals:
------

If any reusability code like tags in aconfiguration file then we can define in a locals block in config file and use with the tag local.name

eg::mian.tf
		
		locals {
			tags = 	{
				name = "sai"
				sur-name = "krishna"
				}
			}

we can call this as local.tags

dynamic bocks: reduce the use of same block repetedly like ingress rules in SG of aws
syntax: dynamic "ingress" { 
		for_each = var.rules
		content {
		#common code here
		from_port = ingress.value
		to_port = ingress.value
		protocal = "tcp"
		cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
		}
	}


variable "rules" {
		type = set
		default = ["22", "8080"]
		}

also iterator as well instead of dynamic variable name as mentioned below 


dynamic "ingress" { 
		iterator = port
		for_each = var.rules
		content {
		#common code here
		from_port = port.value
		to_port = port.value
		protocal = "tcp"
		cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
		}


splat is nothing but using * in output variables to reflect all similar type of variable

output "ports" {
	value = aws_seucrity_group.backend-sg.ingress[*].to-port
	}



alias, for using the same provider with different configurations for different resources

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Additional provider configuration for west coast region; resources can
# reference this as `aws.west`.
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}
